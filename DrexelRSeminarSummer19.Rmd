Ok, this is my first effort at making a course in RStudio.

To get to this point you've done the basics of getting R installed, RStudio, and connecting it to Git.

You will want to Fork this Repo to make your own. 

To get started you'll need to install some packages, they are:

here, pacman, tidyverse

In order to get started, you have an assignment: 
I have provided in the data folder several files that include the test responses and the grades for two classes, as well as a grading key. 

The first part of this course will get you going and require you to clean up this data - NO EXCEL!!!!

I want a script that imports the data, combines it all into one dataframe, and that correlates the test score with the quiz 1 grade and quiz 2 grade.  


```{r SetupEnvironment, echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(here, tidyverse)

```
